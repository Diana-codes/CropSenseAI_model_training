## üìú Project Summary
CropSense AI is a machine learning‚Äìdriven plant disease detection system tailored for smallholder farmers in Rwanda. Every year, local farmers lose up to 30% of crop yields due to undiagnosed diseases and pest attacks. CropSense empowers farmers with a mobile tool that uses computer vision to diagnose plant diseases from images ‚Äî even offline, using low-end smartphones.

The project uses the **PlantVillage** dataset and multiple classification models (CNN and VGG16 + Logistic Regression) to identify crop diseases effectively.

## üöú Motivation & Problem
Although over 70% of Rwandans work in agriculture, most lack access to timely expert advice. The shortage of extension officers, limited connectivity, and generalized AI tools are major barriers.

CropSense solves this by:
- Using a publicly available, diverse plant disease dataset
- Providing offline detection using optimized models
- Targeting low-end Android smartphones
- Supporting multiple disease categories across major crops

## üìÇ Dataset Summary
- **Source:** TensorFlow Datasets ‚Üí [`plant_village`](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/plant_village)
- **Classes:** 38+ crop disease classes (e.g., Tomato Early Blight, Apple Scab, Potato Late Blight)
- **Images:** ~54,000 color images
- **Preprocessing:** Normalized, resized to 64x64 pixels
- **Split:** 80% training, 20% validation

## üèÜ Best Model: Instance 1 (CNN + Adam, No Regularization)

- **Why it's best:** Achieved the highest accuracy (89.15%) and a strong F1-score with minimal tuning.
- **Characteristics:** Lightweight, efficient, and generalizable for real-world smartphone deployment.
- **Saved as:** `saved_models/best_model.keras`

---

## üß™ Evaluation Strategy
All models were evaluated on the same test set. Metrics used:
- **Accuracy**
- **F1 Score**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **Loss**
- **Confusion Matrix** (via Seaborn)

## üîÆ Prediction Pipeline
- Final predictions use the best model: `best_model.keras`
- VGG16 + Logistic Regression version is also available as backup
- Custom prediction function available in notebook
