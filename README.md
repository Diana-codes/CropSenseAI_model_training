## üìú Project Summary
CropSense AI is a machine learning‚Äìdriven plant disease detection system tailored for smallholder farmers in Rwanda. Every year, local farmers lose up to 30% of crop yields due to undiagnosed diseases and pest attacks. CropSense aims to solve this by empowering farmers with a mobile tool that uses computer vision to diagnose plant diseases from images ‚Äî even offline, using low-end smartphones.

The project is built on a plant image classification model trained on the **PlantVillage** dataset and optimized for performance in low-resource environments. Our goal is to support Rwanda‚Äôs Vision 2050 goals for digital agriculture and food security.

## üöú Motivation & Problem
Despite agriculture employing over 70% of Rwandans, many farmers cannot access expert support in time to diagnose crop issues. Extension officer shortages, limited internet access, and non-local AI models have all contributed to poor crop protection.

CropSense addresses this by:
- Using locally relevant image data (PlantVillage)
- Running completely offline on entry-level Android phones
- Supporting multiple crops and disease classes
- Empowering youth and farmers to co-create a more resilient agricultural system

## üèÜ Best Model: Instance 5 (VGG16 + Logistic Regression)

- **Why it‚Äôs best:** Outperformed all CNN-based models in accuracy and generalization.
- **Use case:** Lightweight, high-accuracy model for deployment on devices via saved `.pkl` or `.h5`.

---

## üß™ Evaluation Strategy
All models were evaluated on the **same validation set** using:
- **Accuracy**
- **F1 Score**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **Loss Curve**
- **Confusion Matrix** (plotted using seaborn)

---

## üîÆ Prediction Pipeline
- Final predictions use the best saved model: `saved_models/best_model.pkl`
- Logistic Regression fallback model included for offline inference
- `make_predictions(model_path, images)` is included in the notebook to run new predictions
